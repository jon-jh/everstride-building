# Everstride - A Fitness RPG

Everstride is a gamified fitness application designed to motivate users to achieve their step goals through story-based quests. Built with a Next.js framework, the app connects to the Strava API and translates daily steps into progress on a Dungeons and Dragons-inspired adventure map. The app supports individual quests and includes a social aspect where you can add friends to see their progress, fostering collaboration and friendly competition.

## Features

- **Quest-based Progression:** Users are always on a quest, where they progress based on daily and weekly step goals.
- **StepVisualizer:** At the center of the app is the StepVisualizer, which translates daily step counts into the avatar's position on the X-axis. The goal is to reach the star at the end of the quest.
- **Gamified Decisions:** After completing a quest, users face random D&D-style events with interactive choices. Rolling a dice may reward users with gold, adding an element of chance and excitement.
- **Real-time Updates:** Track step progress through the Strava API, with updates displayed dynamically on the quest map.
- **Manual Step Input:** For users without Strava, manual step input ensures everyone can participate and enjoy the app.
- **Social Connectivity:** Add friends to see their progress, maintain motivation, and foster friendly competition.
- **Avatar Customization:** Personalize your adventure by editing your avatar through the Avatar Editor.
- **Gold Economy:** Earn gold from quests and spend it in the Gold Market to unlock exclusive items and features.
- **Payment Integration:** Use Stripe to purchase gold directly, giving users more flexibility to enhance their experience.
- **Responsive Design:** Works across devices, ensuring a seamless experience on desktop and mobile.
