# Everstride - A Fitness RPG

### Check out the dev build here: [https://everstride.vercel.app/](https://everstride.vercel.app/)

Everstride is a gamified fitness app built with Next.js, where users complete DnD-inspired quests by reaching step goals. Progress earns gold to upgrade avatars with new gear, while social features let friends track each otherâ€™s journeys. Users can also purchase gold securely via Stripe integration for faster upgrades.

## Features

- **Quest-based Progression:** Users are always on a quest, where they progress based on daily and weekly step goals.
- **StepVisualizer:** At the center of the app is the StepVisualizer, which translates daily step counts into the avatar's position on the X-axis. The goal is to reach the star at the end of the quest.
- **Avatar Customization:** Personalize your adventure by editing your avatar through the Avatar Editor.
- **Gamified Decisions:** After completing a quest, users face random D&D-style events with interactive choices. Rolling a dice may reward users with gold.
- **Social Connectivity:** Add friends to see their progress, maintain motivation, and foster friendly competition.
- **Gold Economy:** Earn gold from quests and spend it in the Gold Market to unlock new equipment.
- **Payment Integration:** Use Stripe to purchase gold directly with secure payments.
